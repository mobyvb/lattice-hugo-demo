## Features

* glossary (site wide, defined as json or something)
* footnotes (per page, including links/jumping)

## Styling/Visuals

* use sass or something so I can easily experiment with colors
* header nav styles
* better colors/fonts
* don't use px for font sizes
* add other lattice patterns - allow configuration of different lattice patterns for different parts of the site (using front matter?)
* parallax background images on moving the mouse
* new cloud images
* responsive width

## Performance

* preload assets for night mode and theme toggle svgs
* when in night mode, just load night mode assets - no flashing light theme

## Misc

* credits
* cleanup/host demo on gh pages
* separate repo for theme - use a submodule for this repo
