* when in night mode, just load night mode assets - no flashing light theme
* header nav styles
* use sass or something so I can easily experiment with colors
* responsive width
* new cloud images
* parallax background images on moving the mouse
* don't use px for font sizes
* add other lattice patterns - allow configuration of different lattice patterns for different parts of the site
* credits
* better colors/fonts
* preload assets for night mode and theme toggle svgs
